      "description": "tell users about pro features",
      "trigger_name": "proplan",
      "emails": [
        {
          "trigger": "time",
          "sendDelay": 1,
          "subject": "Have you tried Feature A?",
          "body": "Feature A will let you do ABC things. <p>We can also do HTML!</p>",
          "from": "abc@gmail.com"
        },
        {
          "trigger": "time",
          "sendDelay": 3,
          "subject": "Try our feature B!",
          "body": "We released feature B just last week and can't wait for you to try it out :)",
          "from": "abc@gmail.com"
        }
